# Cataclysm-ROTR
This is a mod for Cataclysm in which the lore is very, VERY different: the Cataclysm never happens.
Instead a robot uprising occurs, androids with a high degree of intelligence rule over Earth. 
They are served by other robots with lesser intelligence directly controlled by them, usually used for combat.
Basically Terminator except without Arnold and rebel robots.

- Removes ALL original monsters and monster overmap tiles (beehives, anthills, goo pits)
- Adds robot stuff
