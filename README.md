# Cataclysm: Rise of the Robots Mod
Cataclysm Game: https://github.com/Whales/Cataclysm

This is a mod for Cataclysm in which the lore is very, VERY different: the Cataclysm never happens. (which is why I gave it a fancy acronym)
Instead a robot uprising occurs, androids with a high degree of intelligence rule over Earth. 
They are served by other robots with lesser intelligence directly controlled by them, usually used for combat.

Changes the entire game's lore:
- Removes ALL original monsters (zombies) and monster overmap tiles (beehives, anthills, goo pits)
- Adds robot stuff
